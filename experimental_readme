For experimental branch!


-iOS - 1/18/2012
	-currently drawing using shaders in es 2.0
	-handles colors well
	-taking a 4x4 matrix via four vec4 calls rotx where x = {0,1,2,3} and each vector is referring to a column in the mat4
	-TODO: rotation and zoom via this matrix (defaulted to identity)
		-quaternion? yes...do the all the math in the obj-c, then send it that vector to upadte against the modelview

	-almost able to rotate but disappears on touch
